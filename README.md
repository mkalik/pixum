When you can't decide what to watch, or want to find something new... QUIT SCROLLING AND PIXUM ALREADY!

## Description |

When it's finally time to relax and enjoy a movie, people often spend more time scrolling through options than watching the movie itself! Our Web Application, "Pixum" is designed to rid users of this painful experience, allowing them to find a suitable movie within a few short seconds.

After arriving on Pixum's homepage, the user is prompted with search criteria rergarding Genre, Actors, and Movie Length. After inputting their perfered choices, Pixum generates four watchworthy films that fit the users interests.

"Bookmark Page"
What happens when a user comes across two movies they might love, but they only have enough time to watch one? Thanks to our bookmark feature, they can simply click the bookmark icon at the top right of a movie box, and it will automatically save the movie to your "Bookmarks" Page. That way you can close the app, comeback a day later, and your saved movies will be waiting for you!

"More Info Button"
To aid Pixum users with their Movie selection, each movie card has a dynamic "More Info" button that provides trailers, ratings, and a spoilerfree splot summary to ensure their choice is just right for them.

"Watch Option"
Once a user has decided on their movie selection, the "Watch Option" button within the modal provides them with any and all streaming outlets that offer that film. All you need to do is click your stream of choice and start watching!
