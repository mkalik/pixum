When you can't decide what to watch, or want to find something new... QUIT SCROLLING AND PIXUM ALREADY!

When it's finally time to relax and enjoy a movie, people often spend more time scrolling through options than watching the movie itself! Our Web Application, "Pixum" is designed to rid users of this painful experience, allowing them to find a suitable movie within a few short seconds.

After arriving on Pixum's homepage, the user is prompted with search criteria rergarding Genre, Actors, and Movie Length. After inputting their perfered choices, Pixum generates four watchworthy films to fit the users interests.

To aid Pixum users with their Movie selection, each movie card has a dynamic "More Info" button that provides trailers, ratings, and a spoilerfree splot summary to ensure their choice is just right for them
